- [Travelling Santa 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/c/traveling-santa-2018-prime-paths/).
- required to implement a genetic algorithm to solve the traveling Santa 2018 – Prime Paths. You need to design the representation of the candidate solutions, the implementation of genetic operators (crossover/mutation), and the design of the algorithm.

Steps to execute the notebook
- open jupyter Notebook, execute cell by cell.
- hyperparameters population size and max_generations are to be configured in the second cell.
